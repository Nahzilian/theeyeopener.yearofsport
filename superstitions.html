            Have you ever worn the same jersey to a game without washing it because, otherwise, your team might lose?
            Don’t worry, it isn’t weird. In fact, many athletes have their own little wacky superstitions or rituals
            that they follow before their own games!
        </p>
        <p>
            After speaking to some of the athletes that wear a Rams jersey, here are some of the rituals they go through
            before every game or practice.
        </p>

            <strong>
                Aaron Rhooms, men’s basketball
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            “Before every game, following our team talk, I’ll stay back and listen to my favourite song on max volume.
            The song is almost four minutes long and I cannot leave until it is finished. It helps me get into the right
            headspace for me to have a good warmup and be ready for the game.”
        </p>
        <p>

            <strong>
                Ankit Choudry, men’s basketball
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            “I usually read different books but mostly around the same concept: books that help you mentally evolve and
            can give you perspective. That can also challenge you in certain ways and overall just teach you new
            things.”

            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            “I have a few things I do on game day—the normal ones like having a playlist, waking up at a certain time,
            getting to the locker room at a certain time. The one thing out of the ordinary I do is, I have a GoGo
            Squeez [applesauce] before the game—it’s become a ritual now.”
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Zoe Kuck, women’s volleyball
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            “I always need to listen to the song Mirrors by Justin Timberlake in full before I have a game. I got
            obsessed with that song when I was in competitive swimming and would listen to it before every meet, and now
            I just find it relaxes me. Since it’s a good length I get to think about our strategy for the game during it
            and just relax. I’ve only ever forgotten to listen to it once and I ended up losing that game, so pretty
            self-explanatory there!”
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Savahnna Robinson, women’s soccer
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            “One of my pre-game rituals is to eat a banana right before the game. I do this before every soccer game.”
        </p>
        <p>
            There you have it—whether it’s listening to the same song before every game or having some good ol’
            applesauce, these are some little superstitions thasst keep Rams athletes in check during the season.
