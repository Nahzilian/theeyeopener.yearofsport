            I’m writing this at 11:30 p.m. on a Saturday at the Mattamy Athletic Centre (MAC). Athletes are starting to
            head home, the custodial staff are making their rounds and the bright lights that once shone upon the
            moderately-filled stands have been turned off. The clicking of my keyboard and the air vent humming are the
            only sounds that filled the silence in the MAC balcony.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every night I’ve spent at the MAC over the last three months has ended the same—edit stories; size photos;
            complain about the lack of air conditioning; write social media captions; file our work; pack up and head
            home. But before I leave and when I’m certain I’m one of the last people left in the building, I always get
            up from the blue couch and perch myself over the railing.
        </p>
        <p>
            There’s something so pure about leaning over that railing in the dark, overlooking the gleaming hardwood.
            Nothing beats being alone by yourself in an empty gym.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever I’m up in the darkness of the MAC balcony, I feel like a kid again, fantasizing about getting on
            the court in front of a packed sea of spectators. It gives me a warm feeling inside my stomach. Well, that
            could also just be because the MAC is the hottest building on campus and I’m sweating through my shirt.
        </p>
        <p>
            But every time I start making my exit from the building and I walk down the stairs, I can’t help but think
            to myself: ‘Damn, it’s good to be back.’
        </p>

            The return of sports at Ryerson was a long time coming. This collection of stories aims to celebrate the
            return of the Rams, while addressing inequalities that still exist on the playing field which were
            illuminated by the pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’ve always said the best kind of sports writing goes beyond the boxscore. It doesn’t throw numbers or stats
            in your face, but rather it’s genuine and authentic. It tells stories of athletes and coaches that are more
            than what you see on the court.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although this is <em>The Eyeopener’s</em> annual Sports Issue, these stories discuss topics and themes
            anyone can
            relate to—even if you don’t know how to dribble a basketball, throw a spiral, skate or enjoy lifting
            weights.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you scroll and flip through <em>The Year In Sports</em> issue, you’ll meet the unsung heroes of Rams
            athletics,
            hear from the coaches tasked with navigating their squads through uncertain times, dive into the world of
            the university’s digital ballers and much, much more.
        </p>

        <p>
            While this special issue puts the spotlight on Ryerson’s best, its rising stars and unknown faces in Rams
            athletics, the real MVPs of this project are our dedicated squad of sports writers and photographers.
            Through cold fall nights at Downsview Park, empty arena preseason games and packed postseason clashes,
            they’ve carried our sports section all year long. Plus we can’t forget about everyone that’s been reading
            our stories and sharing them across social media.
        </p>
        <p>
            Two Rams teams—women’s basketball and men’s hockey—will compete at nationals this week with the hopes of
            reaching the pinnacle of their sport at Canada’s university level. But for us at the sports section of <em>The
            Eye</em>, this issue is our championship game—it’s the top of our mountain.
        </p>
        <p>
            So get comfortable, adjust the brightness on your phone and put on a good soundtrack because it’s time for
            the main event.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is <strong>The Year In Sports.</strong>
