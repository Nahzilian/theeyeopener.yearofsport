                    Just two-and-a-half months prior to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Niko Rukavina got
                    married and now has an eight-month-old child at home. On top of that, he became the interim head
                    coach of the men’s volleyball team this past fall.

                    “I would say it was a rollercoaster,” said Rukavina. “Handling the highs of the rollercoaster, but
                    also the downs and the low points. I think that’s been a challenge, but also an exciting part of
                    coaching.”

                    The pandemic greatly impacted the way teams went about day-to-day life. Social gathering limits made
                    it impossible for entire teams to train at once; contact tracing made it challenging for athletes to
                    access the facilities they once frequented; and the effect the pandemic has had on mental health is
                    yet to be fully understood.

                    the pandemic. This number was up from 21 per cent earlier in the pandemic in fall 2020.

                    Rukavina knew the 2021-22 season wouldn’t come without difficulties. He and his staff did their best

                    Rukavina described a team building activity he did with the team to share some laughs during
                    lockdown. He challenged his players to a virtual game of ‘keep up’ where each player had to send a
                    video of them keeping a volleyball up for as long as they could. Rukavina said the exercise brought
                    the team together and gave them something to laugh about.

                    DeAveiro accepted that it would be challenging to create strong relationships with athletes that he
                    had never coached, but that didn’t stop him from doing everything he could for his players. He
                    focused on helping his players get to where they wanted to get to, had candid conversations with
                    them about what their future plans were and tried to help them find jobs and opportunities to play
                    professionally overseas.

                    Coaches don’t only have families at home; they also have a family in the gym, training room and on
                    the court that they need to take care of. This added stress took its toll on DeAveiro, but he

                    DeAveiro said the most recent COVID-19 restrictions in December 2021 that prevented the team from
                    playing were the hardest on him. He saw himself starting to fall victim to depression, so to combat
                    it, he travelled back to the U.S. to be with his son who plays for the basketball team at Valparaiso
                    University —just to be around the sport he loved so much.

                    Jason Saker worked from home during the first year of the pandemic. It was early 2021 when the
                    opportunity to be Ryerson’s fastpitch coach arose, and he jumped at it. Saker said he had always
                    wanted to coach at the university level and being able to do so for his alma mater was a vision come
                    to life.

                    But taking on the role of coach in the midst of a pandemic was no easy feat. Like many coaches,

                    Saker knew the 2021 season would be different from those in the past, and he did his best to
                    navigate his team through the new challenges. In a normal fastpitch season, the team makes overnight
                    road trips to face programs all over the province. But with COVID-19 restrictions in place, the team
                    wasn’t able to stay in hotels, making travelling and competing that much more difficult.

                    When you see Rams coaches in action, they’re probably hollering at players on the court or leading
                    them with fiery intensity. But, behind the scenes, their role is much greater. The pandemic pushed
                    them to be humans first and coaches second, offering their guidance and support in uncertain times.
