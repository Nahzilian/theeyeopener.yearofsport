        <p>
            It was New Year's Eve 2018 and Alex Nisenker, owner of Relikks Card Shop located in Toronto, had decided to
            get back into the collecting game after years away. He and his brother sat around the table with a blaster
            box of 2015-16 Upper Deck hockey cards, hunting down a ‘Young Guns’ Connor McDavid rookie card. They fell
            short, but were able to pull three rookies: Mikko Rantonen, Max Domi and Dylan Larkin.
        </p>
        <p>

            Tearing through those packs with his brother reminded him why he loved collecting cards his whole childhood.
            This moment led to him opening up Relikks two years later in 2020. Nisenker’s passion had been reignited and
            he was interested to know what collecting looked like today in comparison to his youth. He believes card
            collecting has grown to become a respected and popular alternative form of asset.
        </p>
        <p>
            “[There are] really big sort of numbers being thrown around on some of the bigger cards, it's much more of
            an adult hobby now than it was back when I was collecting,” said Nisenker.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a child, Nisenker would spend hours at Sluggers, a former Toronto hobby shop. He would sit at the counter
            going through the single cards they sold for 25 cents, hoping to find a treasure in the massive pile.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nisenker’s renewed passion for the hobby led him to open his own hobby shop. With a lot of free time on
            their hands, many others were also able to find a passion for the sports memorabilia collecting world during
            the COVID-19 pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Throughout the pandemic people were looking for things to occupy their time that were COVID-friendly,” said
            Nisenker. “People were naturally looking through old shoe boxes and discovering their old sports cards, then
            going on Google to find out how much they’re worth today and going down that rabbit hole, and eventually
            re-emerging as hobbyists.”
        </p>
        <p>
            According to <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/7650938/sports-cards-collectors-covid-19/">Global News</a>,
            Bard Hartling, who represents Professional Sports Authentication Canada (PSA), the
            largest and most trusted third-party trading card authentication and grading company in the world, said that
            the value of some higher grade sports cards have increased 700 per cent in the last year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Global News also reported in December 2020 that <a
                href="https://globalnews.ca/news/7516255/wayne-gretzky-rookie-card-auction/">a Wayne Gretzky rookie card
                sold for U.S. $1.29 million, the
                first hockey card to ever sell over a million dollars</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The collecting world has also grown due to more athletes and celebrities getting involved. As reported by
            the <a
                href="https://www.rollingstone.com/product-recommendations/lifestyle/musicians-collect-sports-cards-1132950/">Rolling
                Stone</a>, Quavo, from the rap group Migos, started collecting during the pandemic and would spend
            hours at The Card Shop in Los Angeles, ripping open packs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nisenker said that card collecting now stands on the same level as fine art, due to the big figures
            collectors are spending in order to get the best cards on the market. In January 2021, a Mickey Mantle
            rookie card sold for $5.2 million, the largest card transaction ever, <a
                href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tommybeer/2021/01/14/mickey-mantle-rookie-card-sells-for-52-million-setting-record-for-largest-card-transaction/?sh=51159bc532d0">according
                to Forbes</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ryerson students, like third-year journalism student Nathan Kennedy, said physical collectibles mean a lot
            to him. Kennedy collects just about every type of sports memorabilia imaginable. His room is set up with two
            shelves next to his door: one with a Dallas Cowboys and Notre Dame football helmet, while the next shelf
            holds his signed baseballs. He has baseballs signed by Prince Fielder, Robinson Chirinos and former Toronto
            Blue Jays players Josh Donaldson, Troy Tulowitzki and José Bautista.
        </p>
        <p>
            His walls are lined with some of his favourite jerseys including Tracy McGrady, Vince Carter, Michael
            Jordan, Shaquille O’Neal, Phil Kessell and, his personal favourite, a LaMelo Ball from his days playing on
            basketball team BC Vytautas in Lithuania.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, on top of his dresser, he has all his hockey cards, with his signed ones in hard plastic protecting
            them from dust. The hefty collection includes a Rick Nash, P.K. Subban minor league card and a Dylan Strome
            rookie card.
        </p>
        <p>
            “My dad, from as young as I can remember, would be showing me hockey cards, he would get me jerseys every
            year for Christmas and then I would even get some signed baseballs and hockey cards once in a while.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Kennedy estimates his collection consists of 15 team hats, 25 jerseys, five signed baseballs, four signed
            hockey pucks, four signed jerseys, three signed frames and all of his hockey cards, including 25 signed
            ones.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alongside the rise in sports card sales, there has been an emergence of sports-themed non-fungible tokens
            (NFTs), specifically National Basketball Association (NBA) Top Shot. Sports NFTs are ways for fans to
            interact with their favourite players, teams, and moments by owning a piece of sports history through a
            digital collectible.
        </p>

            <a
                href="https://nbatopshot.com/?c=BS_HP&utm_source=google_search&utm_medium=paid&utm_campaign=within_search_brand_exclusionlist&utm_term=nba+top+shot&gclid=CjwKCAjwiuuRBhBvEiwAFXKaNErO7De-mDUhxCIbwr93p09fyxnOxtxBI3xdLFtNH7K1fplZfVfZqxoCnRYQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">Top
                Shot</a> is an NFT marketplace that allows collectors to buy, sell and collect NBA highlights also known
            as
            moments. They offer the ability to purchase a video of an iconic moment in NBA history.
            On the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L15fYlSAIng">Boardroom YouTube channel in January 2022</a>,
            NBA superstar Kevin Durant purchased his first Top Shot
            moment; a video of himself catching an alley-oop off the glass from Mike James last season, which he bought
            for US$2500.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/7702066/nfts-investment-art-and-sports/">Global News reported</a> that
            financial observers say the rise in interest in NFTs is due to the increase in
            time and money people have spent online during the pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/7702066/nfts-investment-art-and-sports/">Global also reported</a> that
            NBA Top Shot, which launched in Oct. 2020, is a business worth over $280 million.
            According to the Top Shot transactions page, the most expensive moment ever sold involved LeBron James. It
            was the 2020 NBA Finals in the Walt Disney World Resort bubble, where they played private games due to
            COVID-19, that James caught a pass from Alex Caruso as he was heading to the basket and soared through the
            lane, finishing a one-handed dunk through traffic. This moment sold for a grand total of US$230,023.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tobias Roediger, a co-founder of Sentient Labs, said he believes NBA Top Shot brought higher attention to
            the sports NFT space. “NBA Top Shot certainly launched heavy interest in that space, and the big thing
            that's changed is we're now seeing both professional teams as well as athletes launch their own collections
            and really lean into that space,” said Roediger.
        </p>
        <p>
            Roediger also said he believes the emergence of NFTs has not hurt the business of physical collections. He
            expects the two worlds to merge together to eventually create dual physical and online items.
        </p>
        <p>
            “You can purchase the replica championship ring, and then when you go into the metaverse your avatar can put
            it on or wear it on a chain around their neck,” said Roediger. “You can have it with you in both
            atmospheres, both digital and physical.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Nisenker said hobby shops create the chance for collectors to meet and create community.
        </p>
        <p>
            “When you remove that element from collectibles in general, it becomes an isolating experience and it
            eventually just fades,” said Nisenker. “You keep clicking these Top Shots…then, eventually, you're just
            looking at your screen and you're like, ‘What do I do with this stuff now?’”
        </p>
        <p>
            Kennedy agreed with Nisenker and also said that nothing compares to owning a physical collectible.
        </p>
        <p>
            “The physical thing means a lot more to me than, let's say, a Giannis dunk or something, where I have to go
            online, I have to access my wallet, I have to put in two passwords and then I can show someone,” said
            Kennedy. “Whereas I could just reach into my binder and be like, ‘Hey, look at this sick signed hockey card
            I've had for years.’”
        </p>
