            When he’s not virtually roaming the eastern seaboard of Rebirth Island in <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>, Rams men’s
            hockey player Jackson Doherty is covering all areas of the ice and soaking in the first-year experiences as
            the days roll along. Taking it one day at a time has been the forward’s motto all season long, putting
            future expectations for himself on the backburner as a means of staying in the moment.
        </p>
        <p>

            Student athletes at Ryerson University have always juggled school and sport, but this year, first-year
            players also had to factor the Ontario University Athletics hiatus and a transition to in-person learning
            into the mix.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Even if you're not doing the best in school [or] some other thing’s going the wrong way for you, going to
            the rink is kind of an escape,” said Doherty.
        </p>
        <p>
            Getting in the right headspace and managing his time have been two of Doherty's biggest hurdles this season.
            Living in the moment is important to Doherty, and so is the youngster’s goal to “be polite, be thankful and
            be grateful for the things that you have.”
        </p>
        <p>
            When it comes to mental-health, the freshman doubles down on reinforcing his outlook on the game and said he
            checks in with a sports psychologist weekly to keep his mind fresh and engaged.
        </p>
        <p>
            Doherty emphasized the importance of having a “neutral standpoint”—like a psychologist to turn to—and has
            learned not to worry about things beyond his control as the year has progressed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The freshman’s method of blocking out the noise associated with being a student-athlete is similar to
            another Rams rookie who can be found just one floor below the MAC rink, on the volleyball court.

        <p>
            Haley Fedick, a first-year forward for the Rams women's basketball team, has witnessed her first full season
            at Ryerson with a more mature set of eyes than most OUA rookies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fedick was recruited prior to the 2020-21 season, which was later cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
            While only a rookie in eligibility, heading into this season Fedick was the oldest of the young bunch, which
            led to pressure to meet expectations set for players her age.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I came in with super high expectations for myself which was unrealistic for the circumstances,” she said.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the season inched along, Fedick’s “unrealistic” expectations began to evaporate as the rookie came up
            with strategies to tackle the first-semester problems that wore her down.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like Doherty, Fedick approached a sports psychologist and found the remedy to relieve some of her
            unattainable expectations. Through understanding her role on the squad as being a rookie producer, Fedick
            revisited the presumptions set for herself at the beginning of the year and began to reduce the personal
            criticisms of her own game.
        </p>
        <p>
            Trying not to be too hard on herself was the mental tweak that changed the tides for the Rams rookie,
            helping her set her own manageable expectations.
        </p>
        <p>

            While the Rams have been putting in work on the hardwood all year long, very few athletes have had to deal
            with the complete change in scenery experienced by outside hitter Zoe Kuck.
        </p>
        <p>
            Born and raised in Montpellier, France, Kuck always possessed a dream to one day take her talents overseas,
            with Toronto being one of the cities at the top of her list. Despite it being her second year living in the
            city, the outside hitter is adapting to life both on the hardwood and in the classroom—but certainly not
            without some bumps along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            Playing her entire career in a foreign country forced Kuck to learn the sport’s unique language on the
            court. She said terms such as ‘31’s,’ ‘51’s’ and ‘step-arounds’ were the most difficult concepts to grasp.
        </p>
        <p>
            For Kuck, every second on the court grew in importance as the year progressed—something she especially
            realized following the OUA pause in early January. The rookie said she spent the break regathering her
            thoughts, and came out of it with a clear objective in mind. “This could be gone at any second, we can go
            back into our quarantine any second. Have as much fun as you can with it, while obviously being serious
            about it.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Although her consistency on the court remained unaffected once play resumed, Kuck’s approach to the game
            changed drastically, as she said the early season reps made it a lot easier to put the game into
            perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was a tale of two seasons for the young Ram whose nerves turned to normalized confidence both on and off
            the court. Kuck set career highs in both kills (five) and assists (two) following the conference-wide
            pause—a testament to the first-year’s reestablished approach.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kuck credits much of her redefined game to some of the veterans on the squad, who reminded her to “just play
            freely” and have fun with the game, she said.
        </p>
        <p>
            The freedom to play away from both the interior and exterior pressure has been an element to each of these
            rookie’s games that have put them all in a position to succeed.
        </p>
        <p>
            This year, Fedick has enjoyed contributing to her squad’s flawless regular season and pictures herself
            recycling the lessons she learned from her veteran teammates. With seven of the team’s seniors moving on to
            the next chapter in their careers next season, Fedick is set on being the next focal leader on the squad.
            She looks to have “more of a voice,” and help the incoming set of rookies with their struggles.
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s a changing of the guard for the Rams, with many teams at the university set to say goodbye to core
            players from the last handful of years. But the lessons established by veterans have passed down to the
            current crop of rookies and will be carried into the university’s next chapter.
        </p>
        <p>
            And before they know it, these rooks will be established veterans too.
        </p>
