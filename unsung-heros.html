                    When Vince Chu is on the clock as the team manager for the Rams men’s basketball team, he likes to
                    get to the Mattamy Athletic Centre (MAC) early and shoot hoops before turning his attention to the
                    rest of the team.

                    He’ll get the gym ready for the players 30 minutes before the start of practice—bringing out the
                    basketballs and setting up the shot clock and water bottles so the athletes and coaches have nothing
                    to worry about once they get there. When Chu has a spare moment, he’ll watch videos on YouTube of
                    the behind-the-scenes work within the National Basketball Association (NBA), workout videos and
                    highlight reels, because he can’t see himself doing anything that isn’t related to basketball.

                    In high school, Chu didn’t have a plan for post-secondary. All he knew was that he wanted to play
                    basketball, and one day make it to the NBA, like his friend Shai Gilgeous-Alexander who was drafted
                    by the Los Angeles Clippers in 2018.

                    aside and have a little humility and just embrace it,” Chu says. “If I put in the work and just put
                    my head down, then one day, I can hopefully reach the NBA at some capacity.”

                    When it comes to Ryerson’s sport scene, the athletes dominate the spotlight. But behind the bench,
                    there’s a strong network keeping the Rams running that many fans don't know about. Whether they’re
                    working directly with the team making sure athletes are in tip top shape for the playoffs, or being
                    the loud, booming voice over the MAC’s PA system, these unsung heroes are finally getting their time

                    Every day is different for Rams athletic therapist Michelle Bell; from attending practices to
                    offering one-on-one therapy sessions with student athletes, to getting on calls with coaches, to
                    prepping for evening games. It’s why Bell believes that athletic therapists are the heartbeat of a
                    team, with the MAC becoming her second home, and the athletes her second family.

                    Bell has been working as one of three athletic therapists for the Rams since 2014, but her journey
                    at Ryerson didn’t start there. While she was studying athletic therapy at Sheridan College from 2007
                    to 2011, she worked with the Rams as a student therapist. She says her positive experience with the
                    teams, coaches and mentors led her to apply to the full-time position three years later without
                    hesitation.

                    “Ryerson had definitely opened my eyes to what it was like to be within sport, and our programs were

                    Over the last eight years, Bell says she’s established close connections with many athletes, seeing
                    herself as a big sister and supporting them beyond sport. “When you're in this role, you are not
                    only a certified athletic therapist, but you become a provider,” she says, adding that she’s helped
                    athletes focus on a career path, review their resumes and has even driven them home after games and
                    practices.

                    Bell has started several initiatives to provide student athletes with a safe and comfortable
                    environment, including asking a “question of the day” to give them a chance to talk about anything
                    but the sport they play or their injury. She strives to take a deeper dive into conversations
                    outside of sport, and says she hopes to continue developing Ryerson’s therapy program with a similar
                    mindset.

                    Kevin MacDonald hit the mic at the MAC when he was in his first year of the RTA sport media program
                    in 2014. The first event he called was a volleyball exhibition game while training with RTA sport
                    media alum and <a href="https://theeyeopener.com/2015/01/the-man-behind-the-mac-mic/">former PA announcer</a> Alex Bloomfield—or “the voice of God,” according to MacDonald.

                    MacDonald remembers Bloomfield looking over his shoulder and telling him what to say and do to make
                    sure he didn’t miss anything. Once he was comfortable on his own, MacDonald was able to develop his
                    personal PA announcer style and quickly became the iconic voice for Rams games at the MAC.

                    When it comes to PA announcing, MacDonald initially wanted to apply for the position with the Rams
                    because he had “a pretty deep voice and it could sound kind of cool.” However, it was announcing the
                    starting lineups that really made him fall in love with the role.

                    Throughout his years on the mic, MacDonald has established several rituals that he does before and

                    In 2018, MacDonald was set to graduate and leave his PA announcer job at the MAC. Though he called a
                    few games here and there just before the pandemic, MacDonald also works as the announcer at Humber
                    College along with Ryerson where he re-debuted earlier this academic year, training the next
