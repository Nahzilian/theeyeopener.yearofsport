            Just before the midseason break, first-year defender Saije Catcheway walked into the Mattamy
            Athletic Centre dressing rooms with her teammates hours before a game. There, she and her teammates
            looked around the room, their eyes catching sight of their new jerseys hanging in their stalls.
        </p>

        <p>
            Catcheway’s last name was embroidered on the back, with only a capital “R” outline in blue adorned
            on the front; the brand new jerseys were the first of the team’s road design that didn’t include the
            name “Ryerson” like the old ones did. It’s a moment that Catcheway can’t get out of her head.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, she’s waiting for the real changes to be made.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ryerson University’s name change has been one of the most <a
                href="https://theeyeopener.com/2021/06/indigenous-students-call-on-community-to-change-ryerson-to-x-university/">contentious
                issues on campus</a> since it was
            announced in <a
                href="https://theeyeopener.com/2021/08/breaking-ryerson-university-announces-name-change-approves-standing-strong-task-force-recommendations/">August
                2021</a>. Conversations about funding, timing and potential new names have been
            discussed on a nation-wide level for almost a year, with a short list of names promised by the
            <a target="blank" href="https://www.ryerson.ca/next-chapter/renaming-process/advisory-committee/">University
                Renaming Advisory Committee</a> by the end of the winter 2022 semester.
        </p>

        <p>
            Indigenous students on campus say news of this name change has been particularly important, but like
            all Indigenous issues, the range of opinions about the decisions is diverse; some students are
            excited about the name change, while others think it’s an unnecessary change to the school’s
            identity. The impact of the switch has reached all facets of the school—including the Rams, who are
            one of the most branded organizations within the university.
        </p>

        <p>
            On June 3, 2021, the Rams women’s basketball program was the first varsity team to independently
            drop the name “Ryerson” from their team. Other varsity clubs followed suit, two months before
            Ryerson’s official announcement of a name change <a
                href="https://theeyeopener.com/2021/08/breaking-ryerson-university-announces-name-change-approves-standing-strong-task-force-recommendations/">on
                Aug. 26</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ryerson Athletics also released a <a target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CP5nvuBB1DL/">statement</a>
            on June 9 supporting athletes in their decision to
            independently drop the university’s name from team monikers. By the 2021-22 Ontario University
            Athletics (OUA) season, all Rams varsity teams were donning redesigned jerseys that didn’t include
            the school’s namesake.
        </p>

        <p>
            Richard Norman, a postdoctoral fellow at the Ted Rogers School of Business Management through the
            Future of Sport Lab at Ryerson, says creating change in sport is about creating more diverse spaces.
            He says this includes addressing norms and practices that are attached to violence, like offensive
            mascots, traditions and namesakes like Egerton Ryerson. It’s important for teams to interrogate what
            the legacy of their team is, he explains.
        </p>

        <p>
            “I think it's really important that you say ‘all right, the connection with this name is it is
            creating emotional responses and traumatic responses from people,’” Norman says. “And if we don't
            honor that, then what is our role as [we are] continuing this colonial project and on the mechanisms
            that are there, are we really allowing that conversation to shift, to change and actually to make
            space for the peoples that have been oppressed for such a long period of time?”
        </p>

        <p>
            But Indigenous athletes on the Rams say getting new jerseys isn't the only progress they want to
            see. For them, changing their name should be the first step on the road to progress for the school’s
            relationship with Indigenous students and communities.

            Gus Cousins remembers getting into the sport of baseball as a kid. He recalls seeing photos of
            himself celebrating a first or second birthday at a Toronto Blue Jays game with his parents.
        </p>

        <p>
            “I have a feeling that probably kickstarted it at a very young age,” he jokes.
        </p>

        <p>
            Twelve years ago, at the age of nine, Cousins started playing baseball competitively. Before coming
            to Ryerson, he played several seasons for the East York Bulldogs and was excited to start playing at
            the university level.
        </p>

        <p>
            Cousins was born and raised in Toronto; his father is Indigenous and his family's band is Carry The
            Kettle, of the Nakoda Nation. He says while the name change is necessary for the institution, there
            are more pressing issues the school could be diverting funds to.
        </p>

        <p>
            “Last year, my band’s reserve out in Saskatchewan went through a whole boil advisory,” says Cousins.
            <a
                href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/emergency/drinking/drinking-water-advisories/boil-water-advisory.html#:~:text=If%20your%20local%20health%20officials,that%20can%20make%20you%20sick">A
                boil water advisory</a> is a recommendation by local health officials to use boiled or bottled
            water
            when a community’s drinking water has been contaminated.
        </p>

        <p>
            He worries that with the school investing so much time and money into the rebrand, people might be
            getting away from the issue at hand; the mistreatment of Canada’s Indigenous communities.
        </p>

        <p>
            He says Indigenous Peoples in Canada are still facing unfair conditions. According to <a
                href="https://www.sac-isc.gc.ca/eng/1506514143353/1533317130660">the Government
                of Canada</a>, there are still 34 long term drinking water advisories across 29 communities.
            Since the
            beginning of 2022, three new advisories have been added.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2021, <a target="blank" href="https://borgenproject.org/indigenous-food-insecurity-in-canada/">the Borgen
                Project</a> reported that 33 per cent of off-reserve First Nations and Metis are
            food insecure, as are 54 per cent of people living on Indigenous reserves. COVID-19 remains a threat
            to Indigenous populations as well, with, <a
                href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/covid-19-first-nations-omicron-manitoba-ontario-1.6308494">the
                CBC reporting</a> rising case number in Indigenous
            communities around Canada, and a lack of health-care professionals was cited as a cause for spread.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2017, <em>The Eye</em> <a
                href="https://theeyeopener.com/2021/08/breaking-ryerson-university-announces-name-change-approves-standing-strong-task-force-recommendations/">reported</a>
            that the cost of a name change could cost “millions of dollars.” For
            Cousins, he’d rather see that money go towards improving living conditions for Indigenous
            communities.
        </p>

        <p>
            “I just think those are what impact people more immediately than changing the name right away.”

        </div>

        <p>
            Norman says athletics dropping the Ryerson moniker from its teams and the name change of the school
            as a whole should be a launch point in making athletic spaces more inclusive, but not the end. He
            explains that understanding the intention of the name change and being able to recognize the
            violence attached to Ryerson’s namesake, is where progress will start. Norman says it’s important to
            understand how the name is creating emotional and traumatic responses to people.
        </p>

        <p>
            Not acknowledging the harm the namesake caused prohibits the conversation from shifting and changing
            to make space for people who have been oppressed within sport and society for such long periods of
            time, he adds.
        </p>

        <p>
            Part of the reckoning will mean diversifying all facets of sport, including coaches and referees.
            “Having that representation is an important recognition of our visual expression, so that people can
            see themselves in these places. ”

        <p>
            When she was ten years old, Catcheway started playing hockey in a boys league, in her hometown of
            Winnipeg. She remembers how much her dad loved the game and skating, so being on a team was a big
            deal for her family.
        </p>

        <p>
            But it wasn’t on this team that she found her love for the sport. Her favourite time of the season
            was in the springtime, usually right after play ended, because that’s when she and other Indigenous
            hockey players would come together for tournaments.
        </p>

        <p>
            “We call them native tournaments,” she says. “They're Indigenous hockey tournaments where you put
            together a team of Indigenous athletes and you have a tournament for a weekend.”
        </p>

        <p>
            For Catcheway, whose family is Skownan First Nation, these tournaments are where some of her fondest
            memories of the game come from. It was at one of these tournaments that her team became the first
            mainly-women squad to win the championship at the Indigenous tournament.
        </p>

        <p>
            Being an Indigenous woman playing hockey in the OUA, she knows she’s a role model for young
            athletes. For her, being on the team is about much more than her own progression as an athlete.
        </p>

        <p>
            “I don't see it as it [just] propelling me forward,” she says, “But me going forward, I know is
            setting an example for the younger generation in my community.”
        </p>

        <p>
            To Catcheway, the name change is about more than just an institutional rebrand; it's a symbol for
            change in Canada.
        </p>

        <p>
            “The running water, the boil water advisory, the health care systems, the [Child and Family
            Services] systems, all of that for Indigenous people … are ongoing issues that really are only
            taking time because they're not a priority,” she says.
        </p>

        <p>
            Catcheway says sometimes it’s difficult to feel progress from the name change, especially when it
            feels like it's unfolded so slowly, but she’s been appreciative of the support from her team.
        </p>

        <p>
            “It's hard to say conscious efforts are being made because there really isn't much we can do,” she
            says. “ I really respect that [the team is] still on board, even with the unknown of it all.”
        </p>

        <p>
            She says the name change should happen, not necessarily just for the sake of rebranding, but because
            it’s proof that people outside of the Indigenous community are able to recognize that change is
            necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
            “There have been conversations about it and seeing people who aren't Indigenous make some points
            about it, I think it's just very foreign [to me] and I like to see it.”
        </p>

        <p>
            On Orange Shirt Day, the team took a photo in their jerseys and didn’t include the Ryerson moniker.
            She says small actions like that make her feel like bigger change is possible.
        </p>

        <p>
            “It doesn't have to be grand actions or anything like that. But I think just little thoughts and
            people being conscious of it is where change is going to happen,” she says. “So it's been really
            cool this season and sort of being a part of it.
        </p>

        <p>
            For her, it’s about being supported by people who aren’t directly facing the impacts of Ryerson’s
            history.
        </p>

        <p>
            “The whole reason for it is a lot more meaningful than just a name change.”
