                    Kevin MacDonald has seen what it means to be on a varsity sports team and a competitive sports club
                    at Ryerson University. When he was a sport media student, MacDonald worked as an announcer on the PA
                    system at the Mattamy Athletic Centre for five years. During that time, he saw the school’s top tier
                    teams compete.

                    On one side of things, MacDonald saw the elite play of varsity sports teams. But on the other hand,
                    he saw teams where players and managers alike are careful with their budgeting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ryerson University’s baseball team is one of the <a target="blank" href="https://ryersonrams.ca/sports/2019/9/16/about-clubs.aspx" target="blank">20</a> sports labelled as a competitive club. This
                    means that while the team has organized games against other schools, unlike varsity sports, clubs
                    aren’t free to participate in. For many students, this means they have to put together funds if they
                    want to play ball.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “A lot of the guys that I grew up playing with, [their] parents paid for baseball every single
                    year,” said MacDonald. “When you get to the university age, a lot of guys, myself included, [their]
                    parents didn't pay registration fees and now [they] are having to work to pay for it.”

                    Having graduated in 2019, MacDonald is now an assistant coach for Rams baseball where he sees the
                    same juggling act to find the funds to play in the players he coaches.

                <p>
                    Club status sports teams at Ryerson allow students to explore new sports to compete in or to
                    continue competing in sports they played during their childhoods. However, clubs come with a price
                    tag—one that can cause players and team managers to watch their cheque books. It’s a balancing act
                    for everyone involved.

                    Rams curling coach Perry Marshall said the team is “obsessively [under] a zero-based budget model,”
                    adding that the club is strict with their spending and only uses funds when necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Whether it's partially [player] fee-based or wholly [player] fee-based, or whether fundraising is a
                    part of it, or sponsorship…we have to be creative to be able to generate the revenues that we need
                    to be able to support the activities of the club.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The curling club holds a number of fundraisers that relate to the sport, including offering clinics
                    at curling clubs to help members improve their skills.
                </p>

                    Club-status sports teams rely on athletes to help keep them going, among other streams of funds.
                    Clubs come with entry fees, but on top of that, they’re also utilizing grants, attaining sponsors or
                    hustling with fundraisers to make ends meet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These prices can be costly for students, especially those who are already juggling tuition, rent and
                    other expenses that come with living in Toronto. Every club is a unique case, as the cost for their
                    program fluctuates based on the resources needed to operate. Some clubs, like barbell, have an entry
                    fee as low as $40. Others can cost hundreds of dollars per season.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, if one thing is clear it’s that players won’t be denied the ability to play if they simply
                    cannot afford the fee. Some teams have accepted incremental payments from students, and others have
                    sometimes accepted whatever amount a player was able to give.

                    Club teams offer a middle-ground between intramurals and varsity sports, allowing student athletes
                    to push themselves competitively in a wide range of sports.

                    “With the club, at least it gives people an option to be competitive without having to be part of a
                    varsity team or being at a varsity level,” said Jordan Luu, who participates on the Rams barbell
                    team and helps out as an executive member.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A team getting their status changed from club to varsity level rarely happens. The last time this
                    occurred was more than 10 years ago when the women’s hockey team was promoted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nick Asquini, manager of sport operations at Ryerson, said the university isn’t currently focused on
                    promoting any clubs. He said they are instead currently “focused on returning athletes to play”
                    after COVID-19 first disrupted their schedules in 2020.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It may also be unrealistic for promotions to be expected. Cho questioned if the school would be able
                    to pay for more teams to have varsity status: “Where’s the money going to come from?”
                </p>

                    Promotion could be hard, or borderline unattainable. It’s certainly not something that many
                    Ryerson-based clubs envision as something they can achieve at this moment. However, the fight for
                    many to get more resources is an uphill battle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “We're always trying to push to get to that next level, and show them that we deserve to be
                    recognized as much as possible,” MacDonald said. “It would be great if we can be classified as
                    ‘varsity.’ But more so it’s just [getting] the recognition, and the assistance that comes with that
                    recognition, is what we're striving for the most.”
