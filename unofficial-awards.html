            Rams athletics didn’t disappoint in its first season back almost two years. From game winning goals from the
            hockey and soccer teams, to the volleyball team holding down court and buzzer beaters from the basketball
            teams, there were tons of memorable moments and takeaways.
        </p>
        <p>

            With the athletic year winding down, it would be remiss not to take a look back at the year and hand out
            some well-deserved hardware (albeit virtually) to some of the Rams’ standout players, teams and moments.
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>
            <strong>
                Team of the Year: Women’s basketball
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>

            The lone undefeated team, the Ram’s women's basketball team finished the regular season with a <a
                href="https://theeyeopener.com/2022/03/rams-looking-for-redemption-championship-as-postseason-journey-begins/" target="blank">perfect</a>
            14-0
            record. The Rams scored over 70 points per game on average—fourth in the Ontario University Athletics (OUA),
            just behind the Western Mustangs. With no player averaging more than 12 points per game, the Rams truly play
            a team-oriented style. More impressive, they are holding opponents to 51.6 points per game, which ranks
            first in the OUA. The Rams won the Critelli Cup on March 26 and will look to win a national championship
            when the U Sports Final 8 Women’s National Championship tournament tips-off March 31.

            <br>
            <strong>
                Athlete to Watch: Aaron Rhooms, men’s basketball
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>

            In his first year with the team, Rhooms is leading the squad in points with almost 20 per game and with
            almost eight a night in the rebound department. With the poise of a fifth-year player, Rhooms looks
            comfortable on the court as a point forward and getting the ball around the mid-range area. As the Rams
            continue to transition into a new era of basketball under head coach David DeAveiro, Rhooms will be a
            key-building-block moving forward.

                Highlight of the Year: Elijah Roberts sliding pass for Kyle Bollers’ goal
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>

            The Rams men’s hockey team hosted the University of Toronto Varsity Blues for their second regular season
            home game of the season on Nov. 25. Coming up the left side of the rink was first-year forward Elijah
            Roberts with a two-on-two opportunity in the third period. As the Varsity Blues’ defencemen lost focus for a
            split second, Roberts also lost his balance, shooting off a falling pass to the middle of the rink, received
            by first-year forward Kyle Bollers. Bollers had enough space to get the puck past Varsity Blues goalie Alex
            Bishop, giving the Rams a 2-1 lead and eventually the 3-1 win.

            <strong>
                Moment of the Year: Abdallah El-Chanti’s first goal of the season
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>

            In the Rams men's soccer team’s opening game of the season, they found themselves with a chance to put
            themselves up with a penalty kick courtesy of the fifth-year captain. With the rain pouring down at Varsity
            Stadium, El-Chanti faked the goalkeeper, firing the ball to the left side of the net. The team ran to
            celebrate by the Rams fans section, pointing to those in attendance, leaving the Varsity Blues’ fans stunned
            in silence.

            <strong>
                Clutch Gene: Mikaela Dodig, women’s basketball
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>

            Big moments are nothing new to fifth-year guard Mikaela Dodig. Coming from the University of New Brunswick,
            she played four years with the Reds, two of them as an Atlantic University Sport All-Star. In her first game
            as a Ram this season, Dodig knocked down two clutch three-pointers to give the Rams their first win at home
            in nearly two years against the Queen’s Gaels. Dodig finished the game with a game-high 25 points. She also
            had the game winning basket against the nationally-ranked University of Ottawa Gee-Gees in the second half
            of the women’s basketball season.
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>
            <strong>
                Athlete of the Year: Abdallah EL-Chanti, men’s soccer
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>

            In his last year as a Ram, El-Chanti scored eight goals and dished out four assists as the men’s soccer team
            won 80 per cent of their games in the regular season. It wasn’t his most dominant season in his tenure with
            the Rams, but he still had his moments, like scoring goals against Laurentian and McMaster to push the team
            into the playoffs. They were rewarded with a home playoff game against the Waterloo Warriors, beating them
            4-0. The team was close to a U Sports championship appearance, but lost to the York Lions in a controversial
            finish that saw El-Chanti thrown out —the last time he would wear the blue and gold Rams jersey. El-Chanti
            was named an OUA All Star this season for his efforts.
